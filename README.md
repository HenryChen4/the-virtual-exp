Course review app
Helps high school students review courses they have taken.
Reviews by three categories, homework time, course difficulty, and difficulty to get an A.
Made over the course of 2 weeks in October 2020.

Inside contains an original search algorithm optimized for high school acronyms. For example AP CS will search AP Computer Science
or APUSH will search AP US History.
